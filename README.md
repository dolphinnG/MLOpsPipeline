To include a PNG image in your `README.md`, you can use the following markdown syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text](path/to/your/image.png)
```

For example, if your image is located in the same directory as your `README.md`, you can do:

```markdown
![Pipeline Diagram](./svg-drawio/torchddp.svg)
```
![Pipeline Diagram](./svg-drawio/image.png)
